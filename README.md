PelleGlobe is a place for people to show off where they bought their favourite Italian beverage, and to discover the world of these drinks. 

To learn how to use React and related technologies, I've started this project. I'm hoping this will one day be fully functional. I'm using airbase to create a knowledgebase of San Pellegrino drinks sold around the world (there's more than you'd think.) This is the web interface. 

## Install & build

```
yarn    
yarn start
```

or, in production:    

```
yarn    
yarn run build -- --release    
```
