San Pellegrino Terne in Lombardy, Italy has been well known for its high quality water for hundreds of years. By 1899, over 35,000 bottles of the sparkling water were produced in the town. In 1932, the first "Bibite Sanpellegrino" flavour was released: Aranciata (orange). Ever since, S. Pellegrino have been producing the wildly popular sparkling fruit beverages using water from the original source.
